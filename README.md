# Task 1 — Local Network Port Scanning (Nmap)

**Objective:**  
Perform network reconnaissance on a local network to discover open ports and services, save scan results, analyze security risks, and suggest mitigations.

## Tools
- **Nmap** — network mapper, used for TCP SYN scans (`-sS`) and output options.  
  https://nmap.org  

## Quick summary of actions
1. Determined local IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).  
2. Ran TCP SYN scan across the subnet with Nmap.  
3. Saved results in text format  
4. Identified services, noted potential risks, and suggested mitigation steps.
